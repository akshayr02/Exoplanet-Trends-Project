# 🌌 Exoplanet Data Analysis with SQL and Power BI

This project explores a large dataset from the NASA Exoplanet Archive using SQL for data cleaning and Power BI for interactive visualization. It showcases my ability to handle real-world datasets, write complex SQL queries, and design compelling visual dashboards. The purpose of this project is to answer the following research questions as well as explore the dataset to discover any interesting insights:


- What detection methods are most effective in terms of number of discovered planets?
- Which missions contributed the most discoveries?
- What are the properties of the commonly discovered exoplanets?
- How has the number and properties of discovered exoplanets changed over time?

## 🔍 Project Steps

1. **Data Importing**: Imported large CSV into MySQL using staging table and `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Parsed and normalized inconsistent values, renamed columns, converted types.
3. **Schema Design**: Created structured table with meaningful column names.
4. **Analysis**:
5. **Visualization**: Connected Power BI to MySQL to build interactive visualizations.
